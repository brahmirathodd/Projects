# Turtle Race Simulation

## Introduction

This project simulates a turtle race using Python's Turtle graphics library. The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic programming concepts such as loops, functions, and random number generation, as well as to provide a fun and interactive way to visualize turtle graphics.

## Project Description

The turtle race simulation involves eight turtles, each representing a famous runner. The turtles race along eight tracks, each 500 pixels long. The race winner is determined randomly, and the winner is announced with a special message displayed on the screen.

## Features

- **Eight Tracks**: The race consists of eight visible tracks, each 500 pixels long.
- **Eight Turtles**: Eight turtles of different colors race against each other.
- **Famous Runners' Names**: Each turtle is named after a famous runner, and their names are displayed at the start of the race.
- **Random Winner**: The winner of the race is determined randomly.
- **Winner Announcement**: The winning turtle is announced with a special message displayed on the screen.
- **Dark Green Background**: The race takes place on a dark green background.
- **Highlighted Winner**: The winning turtle is highlighted outside the track area.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the `turtle_race.ipynb` code into a Python file.
3. Run the Python file using your Python interpreter.
